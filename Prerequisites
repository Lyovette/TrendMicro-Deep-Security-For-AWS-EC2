VPC must have DNS support enabled, for details see here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html
Linux instances must have the curl package installed (normally installed by default).
A security group on the Trend VPC interface endpoint must allow required inbound accesses for port 443, 4120, 4122, 5275, 8443. (The source must be the VPC IP range.) 
A security group must allow all these ports outbound as well. (The destination must be the SG itself.)
If there's an external NLB/ALB, it should listen on the same ports too.
Private Route53 hosted zone for the given VPC for yoururl.com must exist - this will set custom DNS in the VPC which will resolve Trend Micro requests from the agent to the DNS of the Trend Micro VPC endpoint
If SSM is used: Endpoints for regional AWS services (SSM & EC2Messages) with permissive security group - this will allow commands to be run on servers which will handle agent installation without exposing instances to internet.
An IAM role attached to the instance which has the following AWS-managed policy attached: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2RoleforSSM - this provides the instance with required permissions to work with AWS SSM.
